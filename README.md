# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-for-Finance

In this repository I upload my solutions to the excercises of the course [Python & Machine Learning for Financial Analysis
](https://www.udemy.com/course/ml-and-python-in-finance-real-cases-and-practical-solutions).
I use the skeleton and the course videos to create my own notebooks, so there might be differences between the course and my own notebooks.
